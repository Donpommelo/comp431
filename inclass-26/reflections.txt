I enjoyed working with react and redux. The game for homework assignment 3 was also fun.
I was consistently satisfied with the help I received from the professor and the TAs during class and offices hours.
My biggest annoyance was the time it took for assignments to be graded. When each homework builds off of the one before it, it was frustrating to learn what I did wrong only shortly before the next assignment was due.
As many others have probably expressed, the workload of this class was high. I know that this is by design, but I would have appreciated getting the occasional break from inclass-assignments, particularly on the night before a homework assignment is due.
I also wish the lecture recordings came with some video or other way to see the inclass demonstrations. But perhaps that would too heavily incentivize skipping.
I don't have anything in particular that I really wanted to learn but did not have the opportunity to.
