1. I thought the delivery on Cloud Computing was done well. The speaker gave the presentation clearly, and seemed well organized. The slides that were presented were clear and easy to understand while also being concise. The presenter also answered questions well, demonstrating familiarity with the subject.
2. I learned the most from the presentation of Web Crawlers because I previously did not know exactly what a web crawler was. I not only learned their purpose, but also their impact on sites both positive and negative. I thought it was interesting how they could act as a double-edged sword in finding relevant data but also slowing things down by sending excessive requests.
3. My favorite presentation was the one on Web Virtual Reality because the topic is one that was already of interest to me before presentations. I liked both the discussion of the technology as well as its connections to applications. I got the impression that the speaker was also personally interested in the topic.
